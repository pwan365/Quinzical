## Meeting Notes

**Wednesday, 9th September**
- Since this was the first meeting, it was kept very non-technical. The priority was to get to know more about each other.
- Thereafter, a [shared document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tO1x4oD1I4r3kxlxod0DCqWr4hXzNxF1erzF1AMnocE/edit?usp=sharing) was created where we briefly discussed all the aspects of the team agreement brief, and decided on some team values.
- The task for both of us until the next meeting is to read over the assignment to understand it well before making a start on it.

*(26 days to go)*


**Friday, 11th September**
- After going through the brief, we were definitely more aware of the scope of the assignment by now.
- In the meeting, it was decided that maybe we should start wire-framing the different parts of the game, while also thinking about the user experience. This was the task until our next meeting.
