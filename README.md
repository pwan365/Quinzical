## Usage Instructions
1. Make sure to firstly test this on the latest SE206 VirtualBox Image to have the required dependencies, and also install the voices provided by Catherine to use the New Zealand accent.

2. To get started, first install **festival** and **festlex-oald** text-to-speech dependencies using the commands below.

```
sudo apt-get install festival
sudo apt-get install festlex-oald
```
3. Place the `.jar` file, `run_game.sh` script, and `Quinzical` file which contains the questions, into a new directory of your choice.

4. Open the terminal and change the current working directory to the directory created above.

5.  To run the game, give executable permissions to the script file.

```
chmod +x run_game.sh
```

6. Run the game using this command. Please do note that this script is tailored for the second version of the SE206 image, given that you have installed the voices provided by Catherine.

```
./run_game.sh
```
